# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is part of the **Prodigy InfoTech Machine Learning Internship (Task-01)**.

## 📌 Task Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on:
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 📊 Dataset
House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques (Kaggle)

## 🔍 Approach
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Selected relevant features (area, bedrooms, bathrooms)
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Trained a Linear Regression model
5. Evaluated the model using MAE, RMSE, and R² score
6. Tested the model with custom inputs

## ✅ Results
The model successfully predicts house prices based on user-provided inputs with reasonable accuracy.
